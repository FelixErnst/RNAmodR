# RNAmodR

This package provides a scafold functionality to score per position read data
in search for specific modification patterns. Pattern recognition 
for m7G, D and m3C based on their sensitivity for Alkaniline treatment causing
specific read stops is included as an example.

Currently the following modifications are supported grouped by treatments

* Alkanaline
    + m7G
    + D
    + m3C

* RNA-Seq
    + Inosine

* Alkaline
    + RiboMethSeq
